 * "About DSI Dataset"


Dynamic spectral images datasets are intended to define tasks that are distinct from those defined for traditional hyperspectral/multispectral image datasets.

The DSI dataset adds a temporal dimension to conventional static spectral image data, enabling spectral images to produce spectrally coherent motion information in a temporal sequence, and can be used for joint temporal-spectral coding for imaging system development and computer vision tasks with high-dimensional data.
